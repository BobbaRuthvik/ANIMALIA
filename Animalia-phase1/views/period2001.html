                                Grey slender lorises were once classified as Loris tardigradus lydekkerianus, a subspecies of Loris tardigradus. In 2001, this taxonomy was updated based on behavioral, geographic, and morphological data.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The species are unusually social, sleeping in groups and regularly interacting with other individuals during nighttime foraging.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The species also occasionally exhibit fast locomotion, which has not been observed in other species of Lorisidae. Lastly, the slender loris species are uniquely gregarious, emitting loud contact calls throughout the night.

                        <b>Scientific name:</b>Python molurus
                        <br>
                        <b>Status:</b>Near Threatened <br>
                        <b>Weight:</b>Can weigh as much as 137 kg (300 lbs.)
                        <br>
                        <b>Size:</b>Can grow to lengths of about 7.6 m (25 ft)

                        <b>Population:</b>5000 <br>
                        <b>Habitat:</b>This species can adapt to a large range of habitats, including marshes, swamps, jungles, rocky regions, rice paddies, riverbanks and close to small villages, but always near a permanent source of water. <br>
                        <b>Diet:</b>Large predators feed on mammals, birds, and reptiles. Large specimens can even eat animals as large as wild boar and young deer, although they prefer smaller prey, such as rat-sized rodents.
                        <br>
                        <b>Range:</b>Python molurus ranges across the lower half of the Asian continent. The species' western limit is thought to be the Indus Valley.

                            Depending on the female's size, the clutch can be larger or smaller, varying from 10 to 107 eggs, which the female incubates by curving her body around them. Continuous, visible muscle contractions increase the animal�s body temperature and provide a higher temperature when incubating the eggs, which lasts for two to three months. Babies measure some 50 cm long when they are born.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As an interesting fact for a tropical boa, populations in the north of their area of distribution hibernate for a short period of time. Like all boas, it is not venomous and kills prey by constriction, wrapping around them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The main dangers to this species are the destruction of its habitat and overhunting for human food and for their skins, highly valued in the leather trade.

                                Declines in batoids from intense and increasing fishing has been reported for India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.. The entire geographic range of the species is subject to intense and increasing fishing pressure with little refuge at depth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The steep decline in landings of batoids in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan is consistent with a population reduction of 54 to 84% over three generation lengths (26 years). Hence, it is suspected that the Indian Sharpnose Ray has undergone a population reduction of 50 to 79% over the past three generation lengths (26 years) due to levels of exploitation

                                The venom of Ophiophagus hannah is very potent. It is a strong neurotoxin, which affects respiratory centres in the medulla of the brain. Death results from respiratory arrest and cardiac failure. Death may occur in a very short time, but, as with any bite, the location of the bite and the efficacy of first aid and medical treatment may delay or prevent death.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               The anti-venom, sometimes referred to as anti-venin, reverses the actions of the neurotoxins (proteins and enzymes). Anti-venin, even after five or six decades, is still the most trusted and commonly used method in controlling snake venom poisoning.
