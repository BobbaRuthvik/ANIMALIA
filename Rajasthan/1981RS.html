          <h3>Caracal</h3>
          <ul>
            <b>Scientific name:</b>Caracal caracal
<br>
            <b>Status:</b> Least Concern<br>
            <b>Weight:</b> (6 to 16 kilograms)<br>
            <b>Size:</b> 16”-20” (41-51 cm), body length of 24”-42” (61-107 cm), and weight in the range of 15-45 lb (7-20 kg).
<br>
            <b>Population:</b> <10–15 individuals survive in the Kutch region of Gujarat, India (Chavan, 1987), and that there are <50 individuals in Rajasthan, India (Sharma and Sankhala, 1984).
<br>
            <b>Habitat:</b>:They live in woodlands, savannahs and in scrub forests, but avoid sandy deserts.<br>
            <b>Diet:</b>They prey primarily on birds, rodents and small antelopes. Like most cats, caracals stalk their prey before pouncing on it. In areas of human settlement, these cats sometimes eat poultry.<br>
            <b>Range:</b>Caracals are found in most regions of Africa and from the Arabian Peninsula through northwest India.</ul><br>

              <p>As a desert animal, they can survive long periods without drinking. During the hot hours of the day, they rest in crevices, and hunt mainly in the cooler morning, night and evening hours.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Their gait is similar to that of the Cheetah, but they are not sprinters, and take to the trees if pursued by dogs. Although they can be considered the fastest cat of their size, their hunting technique is the stalk and spring method like that of the domestic cat.</p>

            <p>Ratels have a thick skull inside their broad heads, small eyes and no external ears. Their ears are enclosed in the skin, with an opening that can be closed to keep out dirt when the ratel is digging.</p>
              <br>
            <p> They have a blunt snout and strong limbs equipped with long sharp claws which can measure 350 – 400 millimetres in length and are used for digging. Their short legs have great endurance and they are able to chase large animals for long periods of time until the pursued become exhausted.

              <p>While Yellow Tit may always have been uncommon, the population has been further reduced by felling of broadleaved forests. It is unable to occupy marginal habitats such as edge and scrub, plantations of conifers and bamboo. </p>
              <br>
              <p>At one time, Yellow Tit was captured during large-scale netting of wild birds for export. Much of its habitat is now secure in national parks, nature reserves and wildlife sanctuaries.

              <p>One of the heaviest raptors in the world, Cinereous Vultures are identified by their bare heads, their dark plumage and their large beaks. Notice the upright neck feathers in the image? This is why they are also called Monk Vultures, as these feathers resemble the hood of a monk's cloak.</p>
                <br>
              <p> Found mainly in the northern parts of the country, Cinereous Vultures prefer grasslands and forests as habitats. They build nests on trees as well as cliffs. Cinereous Vultures feed on the carrion of medium and large-sized mammals, but they are also known to hunt for live prey and feed on snakes occasionally.
