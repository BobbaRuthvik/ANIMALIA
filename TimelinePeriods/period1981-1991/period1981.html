                <p>For over 85 years, the Jerdon’s Courser was thought to be extinct until it was sensationally rediscovered in 1986.</p>
                <br>
                <p>For this reason, very little is known about the bird’s ecology. It is known to be nocturnal and feed on insects, which it hunts by sight.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Settlers put demands on local natural resources by collecting wood, introducing grazing mammals and clearing habitat for farmland. Illegal trapping of ground birds has also been recorded in the region where it is known to occur. Suitable areas of habitat are disappearing and those that exist are severely fragmented. A species recovery plan was published in 2010, detailing priority conservation actions for the Jerdon’s courser</p>

              <p>India is proud to be the sole home to The Indian Bison of Gaur which is the largest and the tallest in the family of wild cattle, even bigger than water buffalo and bison.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Since 1986, the IUCN has listed the Indian Bison as vulnerable because of the declining population. Nowadays, this animal is kept well – protected in some of the famous national parks of India like Nagarhole, Bandipur, Kabini, Masinagudi and BR Hills. These national parks give tourists good sightings of the Indian Bison as the animal is more timid as compared to the Indian Elephant and avoids confrontations.</p>

                      <p>Gharials, sometimes called gavials, are a type of Asian crocodilian distinguished by their long, thin snouts. Crocodilians are a group of reptiles that includes crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and more.</p>

                      <p>Concerns about the gharial’s status has led to a number of conservation efforts in recent decades. The Indian government granted the species full protection in the 1970s with the goal of reducing poaching.</p>
