          <h3>Sloth Bear</h3>
          <ul>
            <b>Scientific name:</b> Melursus ursinus<br>
            <b>Status:</b> Endangered<br>
            <b>Weight:</b>90 to 140 kilograms<br>
            <b>Size:</b>5 to 6 feet <br>
            <b>Population:</b>  Between 6,000 and 11,000<br>
            <b>Habitat:</b> In India,dry and moist forests and in some tall grasslands.<br>
            <b>Diet:</b>As animals who consume termites and ants, sloth bears are considered myrmecophagous. When trees are in fruit, usually during the monsoon season, sloth bears dine on mango, fig, ebony and other fruits, as well as on flowers.
<br>
            <b>Range:</b>Their range includes India, Sri Lanka and southern Nepal.</ul><br>

            <div class="modal-body">
              <p>Sloth bears have shaggy, dusty-black coats; pale, short-haired muzzles; and long, curved claws which they use to excavate termites and ants. A cream-colored “V” or “Y” shape usually marks their chests. Their shaggy fur does not have an undercoat, so it keeps them relatively cool in their native, warm climate and protects them from tropical insects.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Sloth bears' nostrils can close completely, protecting the animals from dust or insects when raiding termite nests or beehives. They have a keen sense of smell, as well as near-sight similar to that of humans.</p>

          <h3>Mouse Deer</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Scientific name:</b>Tragulus javanicus<br>
            <b>Status:</b>Least Concern<br>
            <b>Weight:</b>1 to 2 kilograms <br>
            <b>Size:</b>With an average length of 45 cm (18 in) and an average height of 30 cm (12 in)<br>
            <b>Population Density:</b>  between 6,000 and 11,000
<br>
            <b>Habitat:</b>The Indian mouse deer is found in deciduous, semi-evergreen and evergreen forests, and may be in thick old plantations with good undergrowth, never very far from water. Riverine forests are its preferred habitat.<br>
            <b>Diet:</b>In the wild, lesser Malayan mouse deer are commonly herbivores and folivores, eating leaves, buds, shrubs, and fruits that have fallen from trees. In zoos, mouse deer tend to eat insects as well as leaves and fruits (Nowak and Paradiso, 1983).<br>
            <b>Range:</b>Mouse-deer are small, hornless ungulates that live in Asian and African tropical forests. Little has been published on their ecology and role in the tropical forest ecosystem of these areas.

            <p>The family was widespread and successful from the Oligocene (34 million years ago) through the Miocene (about 5 million years ago), but has remained almost unchanged over that time and remains as an example of primitive ruminant form.</p>
              <br>
            <p>They have four-chambered stomachs to ferment tough plant foods, but the third chamber is poorly developed. Though most species feed exclusively on plant material, the water chevrotain occasionally takes insects and crabs or scavenges meat and fish.[15] Like other ruminants, they lack upper incisors. They give birth to only a single young.

              <p>The Asiatic black bear populations outside protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh are threatened by the transnational wildlife trade.</p>
              <br>
              <p>With poaching emerging as the key threat, conservationists from indigenous communities caution that conflating commercial hunting and poaching with traditional hunting runs the risk of undermining local conservation initiatives.</p>

Dolphins are one of the oldest creatures in the world along with some species of turtles, crocodiles and sharks. The Ganges river dolphin was officially discovered in 1801.
</p>
                <br>
              <p>Ganges river dolphins once lived in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. But the species is extinct from most of its early distribution ranges.
