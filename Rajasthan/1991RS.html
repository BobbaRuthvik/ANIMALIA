              <p>Nest is made with dead leaves and twigs, well woven with spider webs. It is lined with fine grasses, rootlets and hair. We can also find paper and plastic, and bark. Nest is an open cup built by both adults.
Female lays 2 to 4 pink-white eggs, spotted with brown. Incubation lasts about 12 to 14 days, shared by both parents.
</p>
              <br>
              <p>Young are raised and fed by parents. Chicks hatch naked and with closed eyes during several days. They fledge at about 14 to 18 days after hatching. They return to the nest for food during some days, before to become independent.
This species may produce 2 to 3 broods per season.

              <p>As we near 2022, the worldâ€™s attention has never been more focused on tigers. 2022, also known as the Year of the Tiger in the Chinese Lunar calendar, is expected to be a critical juncture on the road ahead for tiger
                conservation. The last Year of the Tiger, in 2010, brought forth a global commitment to double the world's tigers, known as Tx2, and the world's most ambitious recovery effort ever taken for a single species.</p>
              <p>Governments in Southeast Asia have a chance to reverse declining tiger numbers by endorsing a new Southeast Asia Tiger Recovery Action Plan. Rebuilding wild tiger populations can be done. With the full support of communities,
                governments, the private sector, and conservation partners, threats against tigers can be eliminated. Otherwise, this iconic big cat will remain under threat well beyond 2022.</p>

            <b>Diet:</b>  The fishing cat is nocturnal and apart from fish also preys on frogs, crustaceans, snakes, birds, and scavenges on carcasses of larger animals.<br>
            <b>Range:</b> In India, fishing cats are mainly found in the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans, on the foothills of the Himalayas along the Ganga and Brahmaputra river valleys and in the Western Ghats.

              <p>The fishing cat is nocturnal and apart from fish also preys on frogs, crustaceans, snakes, birds, and scavenges on carcasses of larger animals. It is capable of breeding all year round but in India its peak breeding season is known to be between March and May. Litter size varies between 1-4 and the young are suckled to the age of six months and become independent once they are ten months old. In the wild, fishing cats live up to an age of 12 years on an average.
</p>
                <br>
              <p>One of the major threats facing the fishing cat is the destruction of wetlands, which is its preferred habitat. As a result of human settlement, drainage for agriculture, pollution, and wood-cutting most of the wetlands in India are under threat of destruction. Another threat to the fishing cat is depletion of its main prey-fish due to unsustainable fishing practices. It is also occasionally poached for its skin.
