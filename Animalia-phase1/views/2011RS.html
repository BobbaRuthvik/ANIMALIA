                        <br>
                        <b>Status:</b> Critically Endangered
                        <br>
                        <b>Weight:</b>Siberian cranes typically weigh 4.9–8.6 kg (11–19 lb)
                        <br>
                        <b>Size:</b> Siberian cranes typically weigh 4.9–8.6 kg (11–19 lb) and stand about 140 cm (4 ft 7 in) tall. The wingspan is reportedly from 210 to 260 cm (6 ft 11 in to 8 ft 6 in) and length is 115–127 cm (45–50 in).

                        <br>
                        <b>Population:</b>Only 3,500 to 4000 Siberian Cranes are left.
                        <br>
                        <b>Habitat:</b> It is found in wetland habitats throughout the year along its migratory route and at wintering and breeding sites. It is highly dependent on wetlands and is the most aquatic member of the Gruidae family. Nests are large mounds, which are often partially submerged in shallow water.
                        <br>
                        <b>Diet:</b> They are omnivores, eating roots, seeds, sprouts and tubers of aquatic plants, and also fish, rodents, insects and various other small animals.

                                This Critically Endangered species is now only found in one main population in East Asia, with a few birds remaining in the historic Western/Central population. The Eastern population breeds in northeastern Siberia and winters at Poyang Lake in the Lower Yangtze River Basin in China. In the Western/Central population, a single crane continues to winter along the south coast of the Caspian Sea in Iran

                                Brown-winged and pale-necked, with a dark cap; male has whiter neck than female. Often found in small flocks when not breeding. Unfortunately, critically endangered and declining throughout range.

            <b>Weight:</b> 50 g (Adult)<br>
            <b>Size:</b> These frogs measure about 7–8 cm in body length.<br>
            <b>Population Density:</b> 1000 individuals per sq km to less than 0.1<br>
            <b>Habitat:</b>Tree frogs live mainly in trees of forests that are in warmer climates, though some live in grasslands, marshes, or other aquatic environments.<br>
            <b>Diet:</b>Adult tree frogs are insectivores that eat flies, ants, crickets, beetles, moths, and other small invertebrates. However, as tadpoles, most of them are herbivores. Almost all male frogs attract mates with advertisement calls.<br>

              <p>The Amur Falcon is a fascinating migratory raptor. Every year, the small, resilient birds make the daring voyage from breeding grounds in Russia and China to winter in southern Africa. It is supposed that the falcons cross the Arabian Sea during their migration, but much is still unknown about the patterns of their estimated 22,000 km migration.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Because of the long journey, stopover sites are important for Amur Falcons to maintain stamina. In 2012 an estimated 120,000 to 140,000 birds were trapped in nets and killed while passing through a remote part of the Indian Nagaland region. </p>

              <p>Slender racers will hunt various small animals such as insects, other snakes and lizards, and even frogs. They will also eat various small mammals such as moles and other rodents. Black racer snakes face the threat of being preyed upon by various mammals and other snakes and reptiles larger than them. Also, birds of prey such as hawks are known to attack them from the sky. Their eggs are also at risk from various animals like raccoons and foxes who will invade their nests when given the opportunity.</p>
