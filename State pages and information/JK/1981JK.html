              <p>The best place to find them in India is the Greater Himalayan National Park in Himachal Pradesh although they are very difficult to spot as they spend most of their time above the tree line in alpine scrubs and meadows.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In fact, these bears are one of the least arboreal bear species, meaning they spend more time on the ground than on trees.</p>

            <p>On the IUCN Red List, the Pallas's cat is classified as Least Concern since 2020 because of its wide-spread range and assumed large global population. It is listed in CITES Appendix II. Hunting it is prohibited in all countries except Mongolia. Since 2009, it is legally protected in Afghanistan, where all hunting and trade with its body parts is banned.</p>
              <br>
            <p>On the Mongolian Red List of Mammals, it has been listed as Near Threatened since 2006. In China, it is listed as Endangered. In Turkmenistan, it is proposed to be listed as Critically Endangered due to the scarcity of contemporary records.</p>
