                            The Pondicherry Shark, or Long-Nosed shark, is a very rare Indo-West Pacific species, belonging to the Carcharhinidae family. Last recorded in 1979 in India, and in 2019 a specimen was discovered in Sri Lanka that is believed to be a Pondicherry Shark, though the identification is awaiting scientific confirmation.

                                The blackbuck is active mainly during the day. It forms three type of small groups, female, male, and bachelor herds. Males often adopt lekking as a strategy to garner females for mating. While other males are not allowed into these territories, females often visit these places to forage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The male can thus attempt mating with her. The blackbuck is a herbivore and grazes on low grasses, occasionally browsing as well. Females become sexually mature at the age of eight months, but mate no earlier than two years of age. Males mature later, at 1.5 years. Mating takes place throughout the year. Gestation is typically six months long, after which a single calf is born. The lifespan is typically 10 to 15 years.
